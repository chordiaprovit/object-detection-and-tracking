object detection and tracking
This repo uses COCO dataset for object detection. The pre trained model used is ssd_mobilenet_2018_07_03. 
In the video it can be seen that whenever car crosses red line, the counter is increased. Also white and clack color cars are identified. 
All the cars crossing the lines are not detected because either they are out of frame or the detection of vehicle stops.
